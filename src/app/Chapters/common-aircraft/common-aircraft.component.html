            <h1>Chapter 2: Common Aircraft</h1>
            <p class="lead">
                This section describes some of the common types of aircraft that can be encountered in Cepheus Engine campaigns. These are not the only types of vessels that exist, and creative Referees are encouraged to integrate aircraft of their own creation or from other sources into their universes as they see fit.

            <h2>TL5 Biplane</h2>
            <p>
                Using an open one-ton chassis (0 Hull, 1 Structure, Armor 2), the Biplane is a primitive form of aircraft with two pairs of wings, one above the other. It carries an internal combustion engine, Code D, and a horizontally-mounted rotor propulsion system, Code D, giving a top speed of 200 kph, a cruising speed of 150 kph, and an Agility DM of -1. 14 liters of hydrocarbons support the power plant for three hours. This vehicle is equipped with basic controls. There is one basic cockpit and one standard seat. Cargo capacity is slightly less than one kiloliter. The vehicle requires a crew of one, the pilot. The vehicle can carry up to one additional passenger comfortably in a standard seat. The vehicle costs KCr20.670 (including discounts and fees) and takes 9 hours to build.

            <h2>TL7 Helicopter</h2>
            <p>
                Using a closed four-ton chassis (0 Hull, 1 Structure, Armor 3), the Helicopter is an aircraft that derives both lift and propulsion from one or more sets of revolving overhead rotors. It is capable of moving vertically and horizontally, the direction of motion being controlled by the pitch of the rotor blades. It carries a Gas Turbine engine, Code M, and a vertically mounted rotor propulsion system, Code M, giving a top speed of 250 kph, a cruising speed of 187.5 kph, and an Agility DM of -2. 90 liters of hydrocarbons support the power plant for three hours. This vehicle is equipped with basic controls and a Class III communication system (Regional). There is an extended cockpit and six cramped seats. Cargo capacity is 11.86 kiloliters. The vehicle requires a crew of one, the pilot. The vehicle can carry one passenger in the cockpit and up to six passengers in cramped seats. The vehicle costs KCr154.810 (including discounts and fees) and takes 36 hours to build.
